####E17 Scroll-View
---------------------

#V1
Added swipes to allow for swipes outside of the scrollView,however it does not operate naturally. It would be good to add a paning to the view to mimic the paning that the scrollView has as well as add a cascading pan for the sunView and the mountainView.

The cascading pan can show distances and will add an interesting form of presentation.
